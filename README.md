# MongoDB CRUB operation with NODE.js

All the CRUD operations viz. Create, Read, Update and Delete are performed for mongoDB via Nodejs
I used `Mongoose` for connection and `Robomongo` for visual representation of Data.

####Used two `Schema`
Student Schema and Instructor Schema for the opeartions.
